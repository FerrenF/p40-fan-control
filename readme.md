Tesla P40 Fan Control w/ Raspberry Pi Zero W + Python

This small project includes:

```relay_control.py``` - A very small webserver built to run on a Raspberry PI Zero W in order to switch on and off a relay gating power to a blower fan.  
```fan_control_automation.py``` - A small python script meant to sit in the background of a running unix installation, turning on and off the fan as GPU temperature and utilization spike.
